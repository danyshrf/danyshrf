# Hi, I'm Daanysh

I am a systems and cloud infrastructure enthusiast focused on building, automating, and troubleshooting enterprise environments. I am actively building out hands-on labs and currently seeking entry-level roles in Cloud Support, IT Support, or System Administration. 

###  Core Skills & Technologies
* **Operating Systems & Virtualization:** Linux (RHEL 9), KVM, Windows
* **Networking:** Routing, NAT, iptables, Firewalls, ARP, subnets, troubleshooting
* **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker, DevOps fundamentals
* **Administration & Operations:** Active Directory, Bash Scripting, Jira

##  What I'm Working On

- Building a multi-VM Linux networking lab using KVM
- Practicing real-world troubleshooting scenarios
- Documenting incidents and root cause analysis
- Improving Bash scripting skills
- Learning DevOps step by step (CI/CD, Docker, automation)

## Learning Approach

I focus on:
- Understanding how things work internally
- Breaking and fixing systems intentionally
- Writing clean documentation for every lab
- Thinking in terms of root cause, not quick fixes

###  Current Focus
* Preparing for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** exam.
* Preparing for RHCSA EX200 exam
* Expanding my foundational knowledge of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and containerization (Docker).
* To become strong in Linux systems, networking, and infrastructure troubleshooting.
